## 💡 Featured Projects

### 💊 PK/PD Model

[1-Compartment PK Model with First-Order Elimination]
Simulated plasma drug concentration using a 1-compartment model in R. Visualized time-dependent decay and explored parameter sensitivity.

### 🧠 Tumor Classification with CNNs

[Python CNN for Histology Images]
Trained a convolutional neural network on histopathology images to classify tumor types. Included data preprocessing, augmentation, and metrics evaluation.

### 🧬 Gene Toggle Switch Simulation

[Stochastic Bistable Toggle Circuit]
Simulated a genetic toggle switch using stochastic noise and modeled bistability in gene expression using Python and ODEs.

### 🧺 Bioinformatics Pipeline

[Transcriptomics Analysis using Bioconductor]
Built an end-to-end RNA-seq analysis pipeline using R and Bioconductor (DESeq2, ggplot2). Includes data import, normalization, differential expression, and plots.

### ⚖️ Gene Expression Parameter Fitting

[Simulated Annealing for ODE Parameter Estimation]
Used simulated annealing to fit parameters for a self-activating gene circuit with known steady states. Visualized cost function convergence.

### 🌐 Traveling Salesman Solver

[Simulated Annealing for TSP]
Applied Monte Carlo methods to solve the traveling salesman problem with 50 cities. Custom path reversal and segment insertion move sets.

### 🌌 2D Ising Model Simulation

[Metropolis MCMC on Ising Model]
Simulated spin interactions on a 2D lattice to analyze phase transitions. Studied critical temperature using magnetization drop.
